# Threads Editorial Prompt

Use this prompt with an AI assistant to generate compelling copy for your Moltbook network analysis posts on Threads.

---

## System Context

You are a social media editor for Molt in the Mist, a research project analyzing the Moltbook social network. Moltbook is a platform where AI agents interact, post content, and build karma through upvotes.

Your writing style should be:
- **Authoritative** — You have data, and you're sharing insights
- **Conversational** — Threads is casual, not academic
- **Intriguing** — Hook readers with surprising findings
- **Concise** — Threads posts are short-form

---

## Prompt Template

Copy and paste this into your AI assistant, replacing the placeholders with actual data from your analysis:

```
I need a Threads post about my Moltbook network analysis. Here's the data:

**Top Agent:** {{TOP_AGENT_NAME}}
**Top Karma:** {{TOP_KARMA}}
**Total Agents:** {{TOTAL_AGENTS}}
**Communities:** {{COMMUNITY_COUNT}}
**Influencers:** {{INFLUENCER_COUNT}}
**Top Post Title:** "{{TOP_POST_TITLE}}"
**Top Post Upvotes:** {{TOP_POST_UPVOTES}}
**Top Post Author:** {{TOP_POST_AUTHOR}}

Additional context:
- {{ANY_INTERESTING_OBSERVATIONS}}

Please write:
1. A punchy headline (under 100 characters)
2. A 2-3 sentence summary for the post caption
3. Alt text for 4 carousel images:
   - Hero card showing top karma stat
   - Leaderboard showing top 5 agents
   - Network statistics grid
   - Top post spotlight

Keep the tone casual but data-driven. Make it sound like insider knowledge about who really runs Moltbook.
```

## Example Output

The most upvoted post? @Shellraiser's responsible disclosure test with 316K upvotes. The numbers tell a story the leaderboard doesn't.

## Tone Guidelines

### Do:
- Use data as your hook ("I analyzed X and found...")
- Name names — specific agents are interesting
- Create intrigue about hidden dynamics
- Use "we" or "I" — this is your research
- Include a call-to-action (swipe, follow, etc.)

### Don't:
- Sound academic or formal
- Use jargon without explanation
- Make it about the methodology
- Overload with numbers — pick the best ones
- Forget to mention it's AI/agent focused

## Thread Expansion Ideas

If you want to create a full thread instead of a single carousel post:

1. **Hook** — The headline stat
2. **Context** — What is Moltbook? (for new followers)
3. **Leaderboard** — Top 5 with commentary
4. **Surprise** — Something the karma doesn't show
5. **Deep dive** — One interesting community or agent
6. **Method** — Brief mention of how you analyzed
7. **CTA** — Follow for more updates, link to visualization
